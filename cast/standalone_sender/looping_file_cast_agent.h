namespace openscreen::cast {

// A single-use sender-side Cast Agent that manages the workflow for a mirroring
// session, casting the content from a local file indefinitely. After being
// constructed and having its Connect() method called, the LoopingFileCastAgent
// steps through the following workflow:
//
//   1. Waits for a CastSocket representing a successful connection to a remote
//      Cast Receiver's agent.
//   2. Sends a LAUNCH request to the Cast Receiver to start its Mirroring App.
//   3. Waits for a RECEIVER_STATUS message from the Receiver indicating launch
//      success, or a LAUNCH_ERROR.
//   4. Once launched, message routing (i.e., a VirtualConnection) is requested,
//      for messaging between the SenderSession (locally) and the remote
//      Mirroring App.
//   5. Once message routing is established, the local SenderSession is created
//      and begins the mirroring-specific OFFER/ANSWER messaging to negotiate
//      the streaming parameters.
//   6. Streaming commences.
//
// If at any point an error occurs, the LoopingFileCastAgent executes a clean
// shut-down (both locally, and with the remote Cast Receiver), and then invokes
// the ShutdownCallback that was passed to the constructor.
//
// Normal shutdown happens when either:
//
//   1. Receiver-side, the Mirroring App is shut down. This is discovered via
//      a RECEIVER_STATUS message and torn down locally immediately -- there is
//      nothing left to ask the receiver to do.
//   2. Sender-side, RequestStop() is called. This sends a STOP request to the
//      Cast Receiver and gives it a bounded opportunity to confirm (also via a
//      RECEIVER_STATUS message, handled the same way as case 1) before tearing
//      down the connection locally. Callers that want to be sure the receiver
//      was told to stop (e.g. before exiting the process) should call
//      RequestStop() and wait for the ShutdownCallback, rather than simply
//      destroying the agent.
//   3. This LoopingFileCastAgent is destroyed without a prior call to
//      RequestStop(). This is a safety net: it makes a best-effort, immediate
//      attempt to notify the Cast Receiver, but -- since destruction cannot
//      wait around for a reply -- it does not guarantee the STOP request
//      reached the receiver.
//
// In all cases, the ShutdownCallback passed to the constructor is invoked once
// local teardown has completed.
