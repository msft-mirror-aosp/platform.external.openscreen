// The Cast Streaming Sender, a peer corresponding to some Cast Streaming
// Receiver at the other end of a network link.
//
// The Sender is the peer responsible for enqueuing EncodedFrames for streaming,
// guaranteeing their delivery to a Receiver, and handling feedback events from
// a Receiver. Some feedback events are used for managing the Sender's internal
// queue of in-flight frames, requesting network packet re-transmits, etc.;
// while others are exposed via the Sender's public interface. For example,
// sometimes the Receiver signals that it needs a a key frame to resolve a
// picture loss condition, and the modules upstream of the Sender (e.g., where
// encoding happens) should call NeedsKeyFrame() to check for, and handle that.
//
// There are usually one or two Senders in a streaming session, one for audio
// and one for video. Both senders work with the same SenderPacketRouter
// instance to schedule their transmission of packets, and provide the necessary
// metrics for estimating bandwidth utilization and availability.
//
// It is the responsibility of upstream code modules to handle congestion
// control. With respect to this Sender, that means the media encoding bit rate
// should be throttled based on network bandwidth availability. This Sender does
// not do any throttling, only flow-control. In other words, this Sender can
// only manage its in-flight queue of frames, and if that queue grows too large,
// it will eventually reject further enqueuing.
//
// General usage: A client should check the in-flight media duration frequently
// to decide when to pause encoding, to avoid wasting system resources on
// encoding frames that will likely be rejected by the Sender. The client should
// also frequently call NeedsKeyFrame() and, when this returns true, direct its
// encoder to produce a key frame soon. Finally, when using EnqueueFrame(), an
// EncodedFrame struct should be prepared with its frame_id field set to
// whatever GetNextFrameId() returns. Please see method comments for
// more-detailed usage info.
